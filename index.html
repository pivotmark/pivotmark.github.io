    <h1>The Pivot Mark  (U+E302)</h1>

    <p>
      The Pivot Mark () is a punctuation symbol used to mark the moment a thought changes direction. 
      An abrupt change of subtopic <em>within</em> the same overall topic.<br>
      It signals a deliberate shift in perspective within a continuous sentence.

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      The Pivot Mark represents a conceptual turn within a continuous sentence. It acknowledges one line of thinking and then redirects the reader toward another without breaking the flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Look of the Font</h2>
    <p>
      The Prolyn Font in general is like Arial, but more pixely.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The earliest known ancestor of the Pivot Mark appears in the 1780s in the notebooks of Étienne Marlot, a French mathematician who used a small angled stroke and dot to mark where his reasoning “turned.” His students called it <em>le petit virage</em> — “the little turn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 1800s, British philologist Dr. Helena Brackett rediscovered Marlot’s manuscripts and began using the symbol in her own writing to mark shifts in argument. A few Victorian writers experimented with it, but it never entered formal typesetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1951, the symbol was briefly considered at a punctuation reform conference in Zürich. Typesetters rejected it because existing machines couldn’t reproduce the angled stroke and dot cleanly. A surviving note from the meeting reads: “Elegant, but the Linotype refuses to cooperate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The modern digital form of the Pivot Mark emerged in the late 1990s when scans of Marlot’s notebooks circulated online. Writers on early forums adopted it as a way to mark a sudden shift in tone or perspective. The U+E302 private-use version became the most common.
    </p>

    <h2>Pronunciation</h2>
    <p>
      The Pivot Mark is pronounced as “(pause for about a second) Mun.” Not men. Muh‑un. Mu‑un. <strong>mʌn</strong> in IPA.<br><br>
      No one knows where the pronunciation originally came from, but it’s widely believed that whoever coined it had an interest in <em>mesocyclones</em> and wanted a term that echoed the sound of “meso,” then shifted it — pivoted it — into <strong>mun</strong>.

    <h2>What it looks like</h2>
    <p>
      The Pivot Mark has a distinct geometric form: an angled stroke with a short vertical foot, anchored, but not touching directly, by a square dot. This structure reflects its purpose — a deliberate shift in direction.

    <div class="example-line">
      We could follow the usual plan Or we could rethink everything.

    <div class="example-line">
      What are tornadoes? Anyways, mesocyclones are cool.
    </div>
    <div class="example-line">
      It looked like a mistake at first Now it feels intentional.

    <h2>Relation to other punctuation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Comma:</strong> continues the thought.</li>
      <li><strong>Dash:</strong> interrupts or emphasizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Semicolon:</strong> links related clauses.</li>
      <li><strong>Pivot Mark ():</strong> signals a shift in perspective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using the Pivot Mark on the web</h2>
    <p>If you want to use the Prolyn font, use the following CSS code:</p>
    <pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: "Prolyn";
  src: url("Prolyn.otf") format("opentype");
}</code></pre><br>

    <p>If you want only the Pivot Mark, use the following CSS code:</p>
    <pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: "Prolyn";
  src: url("Prolyn.otf") format("opentype");
  unicode-range: U+E302;
}</code></pre><br>

    <p>If you want to add it in one HTML file, wrap the code before this with a:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  CSS styles mentioned before
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
